    Prints a pattern of stars in the console, creating either a hollow pyramid or an inverted hollow pyramid.
    The pattern is formed by rows of asterisks and spaces, arranged to create the desired pyramid shape.
    For a non-inverted pyramid, the top and bottom rows are solid lines of asterisks, while the middle rows
    have asterisks at the ends and spaces in between to create the hollow effect. For an inverted pyramid,
    the pattern is reversed, and the wider part is at the top.

# GET X ALPHABET
def get_x(n : int = 5) -> None :

    """
    Print a pattern resembling the letter 'X' composed of asterisks ('*') and spaces.

    This function generates a visual pattern in the shape of the letter 'X', using asterisks and spaces.
    The pattern is composed of two halves: an upper half and a lower half. Each half consists of lines
    of asterisks that form the distinct 'X' shape. The provided size parameter 'n' determines the size
    of the pattern, allowing for customization of the scale.

    Args:
        n (int, optional): The size parameter for the pattern. Default is 5.
            The value must be a positive integer indicating the size of the pattern.
            Larger values of 'n' will create more intricate and detailed patterns.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided value of 'n' is not a positive integer.
            This exception is raised to prevent invalid inputs that would not produce a meaningful pattern.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return a value. It directly prints the pattern to the console.

    Pattern Details:
        The generated pattern has an upper half and a lower half, both resembling the letter 'X'.
        Each half consists of multiple lines, with each line containing a combination of asterisks and spaces.
        The asterisks are strategically placed to form the 'X' shape.

    Examples:
        Calling 'get_x()' with the default value of 'n' (5) produces the following pattern:
        ```
        *               *
          *           *
            *       *

        *               *
            
        ```

    Note:
        - The pattern generated by this function is optimized for odd values of 'n'. Even values of 'n' may
          result in patterns that are not symmetric due to the integer division used to calculate spaces.
        - You do not require to use print function for printing the source code. 
          Just function calling will print the pattern.
